### How to Run The File 
1. Open the `main.c` file in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Open the terminal and type `mingw32-make all` -> this command makes a `.exe` file that includes all the source codes and header file from the existing folder in `src` and `include`
3. The `.exe` file will be located in the `bin` folder
4. Run the `.exe` File or you can run it by typing `mingw32-make run` on the terminal after you type `mingw32-make all` in `main.c` file
